>>>> Building the right Product and building it right: a glimpse into Extreme Programming and Atomic Design

* Short presentation summary *
Tell the audience about your talk. Will be displayed on the website.

Have you heard about Atomic Design? How about Extreme Programming and Test Driven Development? For sure you have heard about React - a few things, I bet. In this talk you will get some insight on leveraging the power of Atomic Design to build the right product (using React, duh!) and capitalize on Extreme Programming and Test Driven Development to build it right (by exploring the React Testing Library).



Talk description and abstracts *
Tell us about your talk. Describe structure, table of contents and main content points of your message.

Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software, and increase the quality of life for the development team. It is heavily driven by the User's needs and feeds on constant feedback from them.
The Atomic Design framework was drafted by Brad Frost back in 2013 on a blog post (https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and from there on evolved into a whole system. It "details all that goes into creating and maintaining robust design systems, allowing you to roll out higher quality, more consistent UIs faster than ever before".
These two methodologies seem to do exactly what any developer dreams about - to deliver high quality software with consistent and solid UIs faster than ever before.

In this talk I will address the following points:
- Who am I :)
    - just a quick "hello world" about myself
- Extreme Programming 1on1 [5 mins]
    - my experience on working on a XP team for over 2 years
    - test driven development and how it helps
- Atomic Design 1on1 [<5 mins]
    - brief description about the atomic concepts
- Building the right Product and building it right [15 mins]
    - from designs to an app:
        - identify core elements of your UI
        - draft your tests from the acceptance criteria
            - why React Testing Library is the best tool for the job
    - the red/green/refactor cycle
    - unit tests vs integration tests: when to mock an when to use the real deal.


By the end of this talk you should be a bit more curious about using TDD in your projects.
The combo TDD, RTL and Atomic design will give you what you need and your users want - good, reliable software that can be shipped on a Friday evening. No stress attached.
